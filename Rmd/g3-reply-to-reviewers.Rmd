## Reviewer 1

> 1. Please considering showing example plots of LOD profiles for simulation cases where separate QTL are detected; where evidence is not significant to declare separate QTL; and two other types when a single QTL was simulated. It would okay to just show the small allele effects difference and uneven allle partitioning. 

We have incorporated additional profile LOD plots from the simulation studies into the supplementary materials.
